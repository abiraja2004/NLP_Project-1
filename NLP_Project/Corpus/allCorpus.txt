KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Hundreds of Nepalis angered and frustrated by the governments slow response were digging through rubble themselves on Tuesday to find remains of their loved ones after a devastating earthquake three days ago killed more than 4000 people
International aid has finally begun arriving in the Himalayan nation of 28 million people but disbursement is slow
A Home Ministry official in the capital Kathmandu said the death toll from Saturdays 7
9 magnitude quake stood at 4010 with 7598 injured
Nepals most deadly quake in 81 years also triggered a huge avalanche on Mount Everest that killed at least 17 climbers and guides including four foreigners the worst single disaster on the worlds highest peak
A series of aftershocks severe damage from the quake creaking infrastructure and a lack of funds have slowed rescue efforts in the impoverished mountainous country sandwiched between India and China
Waiting for help is more torturous than doing this ourselves said Pradip Subba searching for the bodies of his brother and sister-in-law in the debris of Kathmandus historic Dharahara tower a 19th century minaret that collapsed on Saturday as weekend sightseers clambered up its spiral stairs
Our hands are the only machine right now said the 27-year-old part of a group of locals pulling out blocks of concrete with cloth masks over their faces to ward off the stench of rotting bodies
There is just no one from the government or the army to help us
Scores of people were killed in the collapse of the tower
The head of neighbouring Indias National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) one of the first foreign organisations to arrive in Nepal to help in the search and rescue effort said finding survivors and the bodies of the dead would take time
NDRF Director General OP Singh said heavy equipment could not fit through many of the narrow streets of Kathmandu
You have to remove all this rubble so that will take a lot of time
I think its going to take weeks he told Indian television channel NDTV late on Monday
Many people across Nepal slept in the open for a third night their homes either flattened or threatened by tremors that spread more fear among a traumatised population
In Kathmandu as elsewhere thousands are sleeping on pavements roads and in parks many under makeshift tents
Hospitals are full to overflowing while water food and power are scarce raising fears of waterborne diseases
There were some signs of normality on Tuesday however with fruit vendors setting up stalls on major roads and public buses back in operation
But with aid slow to reach many of the most vulnerable some Nepalis were critical of the government
The government has not done anything for us said Anil Giri who was with about 20 volunteers looking for two of his friends presumed buried under rubble
We are clearing the debris ourselves with our bare hands
OVERWHELMED DESPERATE Officials acknowledged they were overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster
The big challenge is relief said Chief Secretary Leela Mani Paudel Nepals top bureaucrat
We urge foreign countries to give us special relief materials and medical teams
We are really desperate for more foreign expertise to pull through this crisis
At the Dharahara tower Nepals President Ram Baran Yadav told the local rescue team that he would send help
The situation is worse in remote rural areas
Highways have been blocked by landslides and many villages and communities are without water and electricity villagers surviving on salvaged food and with no outside help
While aid has begun arriving in the capital including food medical supplies tents and dogs trained for rescue efforts the authorities are struggling to deliver relief further afield
A crush at the main international airport where relief material and rescue teams are flying in while thousands of residents are trying to leave has slowed the flow of aid
India and China were among the first contributors to an international effort to support Nepals stretched resources
On Monday the United States announced an additional $9 million in aid for Nepal bringing total US disaster funding to $10 million
US Defense Secretary Ash Carter said two C-17 US Air Force transport planes carrying search-and-rescue personnel and supplies were headed to Nepal
Australia is also sending a C-17 to deliver disaster relief supplies Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said and to start ferrying out some of the more than 1150 Australians who were in Nepal when the quake struck
High in the Himalayas many sherpa mountain guides had descended to their homes and villages to see if loved ones were safe
Foreign mountaineers meanwhile were divided over whether to continue their pursuit of scaling the surrounding peaks if their local guides returned to lead them
For me personally its probably too early to say how I feel about that said Canadian Nick Cienski who is attempting a record ascent of six 8000-metre peaks this calendar year
I wouldnt want to continue if it made anybody uncomfortable to continue sherpas included in that
